# python-homework-scraper
This will scrape assignments from bootcampspot

Please make a config.py file with the following info

user = "Your username"

password = "Your password"

the_assignment = "Name of the Assignment"

the_assignment for the first scrape will be the title, in future scrapes, this will be a number when a pattern can be easily recognized.

As early as week 2, students will be uploading their files to their own GitHub repositories, so I will be updating the repository with a txt file for GitHub usernames and a script that will qutomatically download repositories of students assigned.  

When you run the python scraper, make sure you delete the student_notes.txt file and the homework_files.txt files first before any new scraping occurs or else it will append to those files.
