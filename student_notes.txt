Student Notes: As I was reading through the pre-work, the constant emphasis on difficulty started to become a bit overwhelming and intimidating. However, when I read the section about sleep, diet, and exercise, a big sense of relief came over me. I plan to work hard during this bootcamp and do everything necessary for success, but at the same time it is good to learn that the leaders of the program also care about the wellbeing of the students in the program. Thank you in advance and looking forward to getting started! Regards, Mike
